# LP # 
# Regression plot showing the Amount funded fonction of the FICO Score. The dots are labelled by the Interest Score,
# i.e., blue dots are for interest <= 12%. This plot clearly shows that:
# 1.   There is a correlation between interest rate, the FICO score and the amount funded. For example, for a loan
#      of 10000$ the recipients that have a FICO score of 700 have an interest rate of <=12% (blue dots). However,
#      For lower FICO  score the interest should be much higher (red dots).
# 2.   The prediction for a 10000$ loan with an interest rate of <= 12% should be > 0.7 for both
#      FICO score of 720 and 750.
