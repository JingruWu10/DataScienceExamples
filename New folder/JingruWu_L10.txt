The smallest five classes, i.e. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 are combined to form the outliers class, while class 1 forms the inlier class. Data for class 4 is discarded.

1. scatter diagram
	by drawing the scatterplot, we are able to find the outliers, but inliers are usually 
	hard to identity.
 
2. perform dimensionality reduction
	for this data set, there are total of 9 attributes, we are going to reduce the 		dimensionality using dimension selection methods such as the filter strategy and 
	dimension extraction

3. find anomalies
	there are certain ways to find anomalies,since this is a multi dimensional problem,
	we could find anomalies using:
	a. one-class svms
	b. multivariant Gaussian distribution
	c. others like KNN
